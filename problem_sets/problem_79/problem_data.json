  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that can predict the optimal concentration of a specific mixture of chemicals used in 3D printing, given various environmental and material properties. \nAssume you have access to a dataset containing historical data on successful prints, including:\n- The type of plastic used (PETG, PLA, ABS)\n- Environmental conditions during print (temperature, humidity, air pressure)\n- Material properties of the plastic (melt flow rate, tensile strength, density)\n- Chemical mixture composition used in the print\n- Optimal concentration of chemicals for each print\nThis dataset is stored in a CSV file named 'Print_Database.csv' located in the '/home/user/Documents/Data/' directory.\nYour task is to:\n1. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and outliers, scaling continuous variables, and encoding categorical variables.\n2. Split the data into training and testing sets (70% for training and 30% for testing).\n3. Develop a machine learning model that can predict the optimal concentration of chemicals given various environmental and material properties. You should consider using techniques like hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature selection to improve the model's performance.\n4. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared).\n5. Use a library or framework that supports gradient boosting and provides an efficient way to handle complex interactions between variables, such as LightGBM."
