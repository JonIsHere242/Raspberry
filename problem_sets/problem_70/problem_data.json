  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that predicts the likelihood of a financial institution's collapse based on macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rate, GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, and interest rates. \nGiven a dataset containing historical data of these indicators for various countries from 1990 to 2022 stored in the 'Economic_Indicators' folder with subfolders for each country.\nYour task is to create a predictive model using Python and its relevant libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) that forecasts the probability of collapse for a given set of macroeconomic indicators. \nThe model should be able to handle missing values and outliers and ideally provide an explanation of how each indicator contributes to the prediction.\nOutput your results as a csv file named 'collapse_predictions.csv' containing the country name, predicted probability of collapse, and a breakdown of the contribution of each indicator.\n### Hint:\nYou may want to start by exploring the dataset using pandas and visualizing the relationships between indicators. Then use techniques such as feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), and ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) to improve model performance. Consider using a library like ELI5 to provide an explanation of the prediction.\n### Additional Requirements:\n- The model should be able to handle categorical variables (country names).\n- The predictions should be made in a multi-step process where each country's data is evaluated separately.\n- You are allowed to assume that there will be no new indicators added outside"
