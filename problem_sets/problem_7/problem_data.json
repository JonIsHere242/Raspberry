  "problem_statement": "Design an algorithm that identifies potential candidates for a new drug discovery pipeline using gene expression data from RNA sequencing experiments. The goal is to identify genes with similar expression patterns across different cell types and experimental conditions.\nGiven a folder containing multiple .bam files, each corresponding to a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment (e.g., 'scRNA_seq_data'), you need to:\n1.  **Preprocess the BAM files**: Convert the BAM files into count matrices using tools like STAR or HTSeq.\n2.  **Normalize and log-transform the data**:\n    *   Normalize the count matrix by library size and use a suitable method (e.g., DESeq2, edgeR) to account for differences in sequencing depth.\n    *   Log-transform the normalized counts to improve interpretability.\n3.  **Identify variable genes**: Use a suitable method (e.g., variance stabilization, PCA) to identify the top N genes with the highest variability across different cell types and experimental conditions.\n4.  **Cluster similar expression patterns**:\n    *   Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) to reduce the high-dimensional gene expression data into a lower-dimensional space suitable for clustering.\n    *   Use a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to group genes with similar expression patterns into clusters.\n5.  **Analyze cluster characteristics**:\n    *   Compute cluster-specific statistics (e.g., mean expression levels, variance).\n    *"
