  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that predicts the likelihood of a new species being discovered in a given ecosystem based on historical data from the past 50 years. The dataset 'species_discovery_data.csv' contains information about newly discovered species, including their taxonomic classification (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order), geographic location, and environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and altitude.\nThe model should integrate multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of discovery based on various factors. The goal is to create a predictive model that can be used by conservation biologists and researchers to prioritize their efforts in exploring new ecosystems for potential species discoveries.\nAssume you have access to additional datasets:\n- 'ecosystem_characteristics.csv': contains information about the characteristics of different ecosystems, such as forest type, marine ecosystem type, and soil composition.\n- 'species_classification.csv': a comprehensive database of all known species, including their taxonomic classification and ecological niches.\n- 'geographic_data.csv': contains geographic coordinates and climate data for various locations around the world.\nUsing Python with libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy, develop an AI model that combines feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble learning to predict the likelihood of a new species being discovered in a given ecosystem. Your solution should include:\n- A detailed description of your approach and the reasoning behind it.\n- The code for implementing each step, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation."
