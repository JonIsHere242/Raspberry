  "problem_statement": "\"Develop a predictive model to forecast 30-day hospital readmission rates for patients with heart failure using the MIMIC III dataset stored in the `/data/MIMIC III` directory. The model should account for demographic factors, comorbidities, and treatment variables.\nThe dataset contains the following files: `admissions.csv`, `diagnoses.csv`, `medications.csv`, and `patients.csv`. Your task is to:\n1. Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features using scikit-learn.\n2. Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).\n3. Train a logistic regression model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n4. Compare the results with those obtained from a random forest classifier and a support vector machine (SVM) using the same preprocessed data.\n5. Provide a detailed explanation of your approach, including any assumptions made and potential limitations.\nAssume you have basic knowledge of Python and its relevant libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn). Use the following file paths:\n* `/data/MIMIC III/admissions.csv`\n* `/data/MIMIC III/diagnoses.csv`\n* `/data/MIMIC III/medications.csv`\n* `/data/MIMIC III/patients.csv`\nYour"
