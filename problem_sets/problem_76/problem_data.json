Given a dataset containing monthly mean temperatures from various weather stations across the globe (stored in a CSV file named `global_temps.csv` located at `/home/user/data/`), replicate a study on spatial pattern decomposition using empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOF) with three components.\n**Task:**\n1.  Load the data into a pandas DataFrame.\n2.  Interpolate missing values using linear interpolation.\n3.  Apply EOF analysis to decompose the temperature anomalies into three principal patterns.\n4.  Create a new CSV file named `eof_patterns.csv` located at `/home/user/results/` containing the first three EOF components (EOF1, EOF2, and EOF3) along with their respective variances.\n5.  Visualize each component using a contour plot to display the spatial pattern of temperature anomalies.\n**Additional Requirements:**\n*   Utilize the `xarray` library for data manipulation and analysis.\n*   Employ the `matplotlib` library for creating contour plots.\n*   Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining each step of the process.\n*   Provide a brief discussion on the implications of your findings.\n**File Paths:**\n*   Input data: `/home/user/data/global_temps.csv`\n*   Output patterns: `/home/user/results/eof"
