The goal is to predict credit defaults from a dataset of 50,000 loans with features such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower's income, employment history, and credit score.\nUsing the 'Loan_Data' folder containing csv files for each loan (e.g., 'loan_001.csv', 'loan_002.csv'), extract rules that can be used to predict whether a loan will default. The extracted rules should be in the form of IF-THEN statements and saved as 'default_rules.txt'. Ensure that the generated rules are concise, accurate, and explainable.\nAssume that you have access to a high-performance computing environment with sufficient memory and processing power. Implement your solution using Python 3.x and leverage scikit-learn's decision tree classifier for rule extraction.\n**Dataset Information**\n* Each csv file contains features:\n\t+ Loan amount\n\t+ Interest rate\n\t+ Borrower's income\n\t+ Employment history (0/1)\n\t+ Credit score\n* Target variable: Default status (0/1)\n**Evaluation Criteria**\n1. Accuracy of the rule extraction framework on unseen data.\n2. Complexity and interpretability of extracted rules.\n3. Runtime performance and scalability of the solution.\n**Required Deliverables**\n1. A Python script (`rule_extraction.py`) that"
