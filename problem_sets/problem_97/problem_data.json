  "problem_statement": "Develop an algorithm to analyze satellite imagery data for crop health monitoring using deep learning techniques.\nGiven a folder that contains GeoTIFF files with the names of {farmer_id}_crop_{crop_type}.tif, where each file represents a single image capture from a satellite, and the corresponding csv file with the name {farmer_id}_{crop_type}_metadata.csv containing information about the crop's growth stage, soil type, and weather conditions.\nUsing TensorFlow 2.x as the deep learning framework, implement a model that can:\n1. Extract relevant features from the GeoTIFF images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n2. Use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze the temporal dynamics of crop growth.\n3. Integrate the extracted features with the metadata information to predict crop health scores.\nCreate a new csv file called 'crop_health_scores.csv' that contains the farmer_id, crop_type, and corresponding predicted crop health score for each image capture.\nAssume that there are 10 different types of crops (e.g., corn, soybeans, wheat) and 50 farmers. The satellite imagery data is collected over a period of 5 years, with approximately 100 images per year per farmer.\nSome hints to consider:\n- Use Transfer Learning from pre-trained models such as U-Net or ResNet to improve the accuracy of feature extraction.\n- Experiment with different types of RNNs (e.g., LSTM, GRU) to analyze temporal dynamics.\n- Consider"
