  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that can predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) based on clinical variables and lab results. The EHR data is stored in a MySQL database with tables named 'patient demographics', 'medical history', 'medications', 'lab_results', and 'vital_signs'. Assume that you have already set up the necessary connections to the database.\nGiven that sepsis can be caused by various factors including but not limited to infections, surgeries, and trauma, write a Python script using the scikit-learn library to train a machine learning model on the EHR data. The model should predict the likelihood of developing sepsis within 24 hours based on clinical variables and lab results.\nThe script should perform the following tasks:\n1. Connect to the MySQL database\n2. Extract relevant features from the EHR data (e.g., age, gender, medical history, recent surgeries, infections, lab results)\n3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (70% for training and 30% for testing)\n4. Train a logistic regression model using the extracted features to predict sepsis\n5. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve\n6. Save the trained model in a file named 'sepsis_predictor.pkl'\n7. Create a new table in the MySQL database to store"
