The file contains the following columns:\n- `id`: Unique customer identifier\n- `age`: Customer age in years\n- `income`: Annual income of the customer\n- `minutes_used`: Total minutes used by the customer per month\n- `data_consumed`: Total data consumed by the customer per month (in GB)\n- `plan_type`: Type of service plan (e.g., basic, premium, family)\n- `contract_duration`: Length of the contract in months\n- `churn_status`: Indicator of whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0)\n**Model Requirements:**\n1. Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn using the provided dataset.\n2. Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n3. Implement feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information from the dataset, including:\n    a."
