  "problem_statement": "Create a natural language processing (NLP) system capable of generating comprehensive summaries of financial news articles from various sources, similar to those found on Bloomberg or CNBC. The system should analyze the sentiment of the articles and identify key takeaways, such as stock price predictions, market trends, and economic indicators.\nGiven a folder named 'Financial_News' containing text files with the names of {date}_news.txt, where each file contains a single article from a specific source (e.g., Bloomberg or CNBC), can you develop an NLP pipeline that:\n1. Tokenizes and part-of-speech tags the text in each article.\n2. Identifies and extracts key phrases and entities related to stocks, companies, and economic indicators.\n3. Analyzes the sentiment of the article using a suitable sentiment analysis library (e.g., NLTK's VADER or TextBlob).\n4. Generates a summary of the article, focusing on key takeaways such as stock price predictions, market trends, and economic indicators.\nThe system should output a new text file called 'news_summaries.txt' in the same folder, containing a comprehensive summary of each article, along with its sentiment analysis and key takeaways.\nUse Python 3.x as the programming language and leverage libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and TextBlob for NLP tasks. Ensure that your solution is efficient, scalable, and capable of handling large volumes of financial news articles.\nFiles to use:\n- 'Financial_News' folder"
