Clean and preprocess the sensor data\n2.  Convert categorical variables into numerical ones\n3.  Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n4.  Train a Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data to predict equipment failure based on historical records\n5.  Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix\n6.  Use the trained model to generate a predictive maintenance schedule for the next quarter, assuming that each piece of equipment has an average usage rate of 50% per week\n7.  Save the predicted failure dates and corresponding equipment IDs in a new csv called 'maintenance_schedule.csv'\n### File paths:\n-   The folder with historical data is located at: `/Users/username/Documents/equipment_data`\n-   The trained model should be saved in the"
