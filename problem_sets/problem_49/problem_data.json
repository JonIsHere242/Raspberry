  "problem_statement": "Generate a complex, open-ended problem in the science sector:\nDesign an AI-driven system to predict the trajectory of hurricanes based on historical climate data and real-time satellite imagery. The system should integrate with NASA's Giovanni dataset (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov) for sea surface temperature, wind speed, and ocean currents.\nGiven a directory that contains CSV files named 'hurricane_data.csv' and 'satellite_imagery.csv', each containing:\n- 'hurricane_data.csv': Columns for hurricane name, date, latitude, longitude, maximum wind speed, and category (1-5)\n- 'satellite_imagery.csv': Columns for image timestamp, latitude, longitude, cloud cover percentage, and sea surface temperature\nUsing Python with the following libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-image, and Scikit-learn. Your task is to:\n1. Clean and preprocess the data using techniques like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.\n2. Implement a deep learning model (e.g., CNN or LSTM) that can predict the future trajectory of hurricanes based on historical climate data and real-time satellite imagery.\n3. Train and evaluate your model using a dataset of past hurricane events and assess its performance metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared value.\n4. Integrate your system with NASA's Giovanni dataset to fetch real-time sea surface temperature, wind speed, and ocean currents data"
