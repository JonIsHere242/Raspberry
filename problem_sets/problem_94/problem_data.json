  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can predict the likelihood of a bank experiencing a liquidity crisis based on historical data from various global banks. \nThe system should incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze financial reports, news articles, and macroeconomic indicators.\nGiven a folder containing CSV files with names like 'Bank_X_Statements.csv', where each file contains the following columns:\n- 'Date': date of financial statement\n- 'Interest_Rate_Effective': effective interest rate on loans\n- 'Non-Performing_Loans': number of non-performing loans\n- 'Total_Assets': total assets of the bank\n- 'Liquidity_Coverage': liquidity coverage ratio\nAnd another folder containing text files named 'Bank_Y_News.txt', where each file contains news articles about a specific bank.\nThe system should:\n1. Use NLP to extract relevant information from news articles, such as sentiment analysis and key phrases related to the bank's financial health.\n2. Integrate financial statement data with macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation rate, GDP growth rate) using a library like pandas.\n3. Train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a liquidity crisis based on historical data from various banks. The model should include features such as:\n\t* Financial ratios (e.g., return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio)\n\t* Sentiment analysis scores\n\t* Macroeconomic indicators\n4. Deploy the system using Flask"
