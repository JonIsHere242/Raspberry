  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that can predict the formation time of exoplanets based on various celestial data including stellar mass, radius, age, and metallicity from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, write a script that:\n1. Extracts relevant data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive into a Pandas DataFrame.\n2. Cleans and preprocesses the data by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.\n3. Implements a deep learning model using Keras (with TensorFlow backend) to predict exoplanet formation times based on the preprocessed data.\n4. Uses cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.\n5. Visualizes the predicted results using Matplotlib to understand the relationships between predictor variables and exoplanet formation times.\nThe script should be able to read from a CSV file 'exoplanet_data.csv' located in the '/home/user/Documents/Exoplanet_Database/' directory, which contains columns for stellar mass (Ms), radius (R), age (A), metallicity ([Fe/H]), and formation time (TF). The model should output a new CSV file called 'predicted_formation_times.csv' with the predicted exoplanet formation times.\n**Assumptions:**\n- The data is stored in a CSV file named 'exoplanet_data.csv' located in '/home/user/Documents/Exoplanet_Database/'.\n-"
