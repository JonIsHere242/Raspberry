The system should take as input a folder containing PDFs of the floor plans and output a 3D model in STL format.\nGiven a folder named 'Floor_Plan_Docs' located at '/Users/John/Documents/Projects/AI_System', with the following structure:\n- Folder 'Floor_Plan_Docs'\n    - File 'Floor_Plan_1.pdf'\n    - File 'Floor_Plan_2.pdf'\n    - ...\n    - File 'Floor_Plan_N.pdf'\nThe system should:\n1. Use Python as the primary language and the libraries PyPDF2 for PDF parsing, OpenCV for image processing, and Trimesh for 3D modeling.\n2. Parse each PDF to extract the floor layout information (e.g., room dimensions, door locations).\n3. Convert the extracted data into a format suitable for 3D modeling.\n4. Use computer vision techniques to identify architectural features such as walls, windows, doors, and stairs from the floor plan images.\n5. Generate 3D models of each floor plan using the Trimesh library.\n6. Combine the individual 3D models into a single model representing the entire building.\n7. Export the final 3D model in STL format to a file named 'Building_Model.stl' located at '/Users/John/Documents/Projects/AI_System'.\nNote: The system should be able to handle varying"
