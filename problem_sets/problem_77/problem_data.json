  "problem_statement": "\"Design a multi-agent system that models the dynamic behavior of a complex urban transportation network using agent-based modeling. The system should simulate the movement of vehicles, pedestrians, and public transit systems within the city limits.\nGiven a set of GIS data stored in the 'Urban_Transportation_GIS' folder containing information on road networks, traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and public transit routes, implement a heuristic search algorithm to optimize the routing of emergency services (e.g., ambulances) during peak hours. The system should:\n1.  Use a combination of k-means clustering and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to group similar geographic locations based on their traffic patterns.\n2.  Employ an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to determine the most efficient routes for emergency services, considering factors such as traffic congestion, road conditions, and pedestrian activity.\n3.  Develop a web-based interface using Python's Flask framework to visualize the transportation network, display real-time traffic updates, and provide users with route recommendations.\n4.  Integrate with external data sources (e.g., weather APIs) to account for environmental factors that may impact traffic flow.\nDeliverables:\n*   A detailed technical report outlining the system architecture, algorithmic design, and implementation details\n*   A Python codebase implementing the multi-agent system, heuristic search algorithms, and web interface\n*   A dataset of optimized emergency service routes stored in a CSV file named 'optimized_routes.csv'"
