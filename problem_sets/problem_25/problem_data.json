  "problem_statement": "In \"Theoretical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\" by John von Neumann, there is a section on applying quantum entanglement principles to predict complex material properties. Given a dataset of crystal structures stored in the 'Crystal_Database.csv' file and the 'Materials_Science_Library' folder containing relevant physical constants for various materials.\nCan you develop an open-source Python package (using libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib) to predict the thermal conductivity of a material based on its crystal structure using machine learning algorithms? \nThe package should include:\n1.  Data Preprocessing:\n    *   Load 'Crystal_Database.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.\n    *   Filter out rows with missing values in the columns for lattice parameters, atomic mass, and number of atoms per unit cell.\n2.  Feature Engineering:\n    *   Calculate relevant physical constants (e.g., density, Debye temperature) from the filtered data using functions within the 'Materials_Science_Library' folder.\n    *   Create new features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to the calculated constants.\n3.  Model Training:\n    *   Split the preprocessed and feature-engineered dataset into training and testing sets.\n    *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting, or neural network) using the training set to predict thermal conductivity.\n4.  Model Evaluation:\n    *   Evaluate the"
