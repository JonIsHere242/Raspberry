  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can predict stock prices based on a combination of traditional technical indicators (Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index) and machine learning algorithms. The system should incorporate a novel approach to handling high-frequency data from multiple financial exchanges using a hierarchical temporal memory network.\nGiven a folder containing daily OHLC price data for major stock indices (e.g., S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite) in CSV format, as well as pre-computed technical indicators (MA50, MA200, BBANDS, RSI) from the 'Technical_Indicators' folder, and real-time high-frequency trade data from the 'Trade_Data' folder, implement a Python solution using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.\nThe system should be able to:\n1. Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.\n2. Implement a hierarchical temporal memory network (HTM) to learn patterns in high-frequency trade data from multiple exchanges.\n3. Combine traditional technical indicators with machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Random Forest) to predict stock prices.\n4. Evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared value.\nOutput a CSV file 'Predictions.csv' containing the predicted stock prices for each index, along with their corresponding"
