  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI-powered trading strategy that integrates with a cryptocurrency exchange's API. The goal is to predict price movements of Ethereum (ETH) based on historical data, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators.\nGiven a dataset containing:\n- Historical ETH prices from CoinGecko API (https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/ethereum?localization=false&tickers=false&market_data=true&community_data=false&developer_data=false&sparkline=false)\n- Twitter data of Ethereum-related tweets using the `tweepy` library to fetch tweets via the Twitter API\n- Sentiment analysis of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with `NLTK` and `spaCy`\n- Technical indicators such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands calculated using the `TA-Lib` library\nThe task is to develop a Python script that:\n1. Fetches historical data from CoinGecko API and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame\n2. Collects Twitter data of Ethereum-related tweets using Tweepy and stores it in another Pandas DataFrame\n3. Performs sentiment analysis on the collected tweets and stores the results in a new column of the tweets DataFrame\n4. Calculates technical indicators for ETH prices using TA-Lib and stores them in additional columns of the historical data DataFrame\n5. Integrates historical data, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators to develop an AI-powered trading strategy that predicts price movements of Ethereum (ETH"
