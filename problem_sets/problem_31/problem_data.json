Given a dataset of photoperiod (light-dark cycle) and temperature data for the past year stored in the 'Photoperiod_Data.csv' file located in the '/data/plant_circadian_rhythm/' directory, predict the timing of the plant's flowering event based on the simulated circadian rhythm.\nImplement a non-linear regression model using Gaussian processes to forecast the plant's growth stages (seedling, vegetative, reproductive) over a 6-month period with hourly resolution. Use the 'GPRegression' module from the SciPy library and assume an underlying probabilistic structure for the data.\nYour solution should include:\n- A Python script that loads the dataset and preprocesses it for analysis\n- Implementation of the Gaussian process regression model to predict the plant's growth stages\n- Visualization of the predicted growth stages using Matplotlib and/or Seaborn libraries\n- Creation of a new CSV file called 'predicted_growth_stages.csv' containing the predicted timing of the flowering event and hourly predictions of the growth stages\nThe dataset is stored in the '/data/plant_circadian_rhythm/' directory and includes the following columns: Date, Photoperiod (light-dark cycle), Temperature, Growth Stage. The data is assumed to be collected at"
