Implement a machine learning algorithm using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) to predict energy output for each turbine based on its characteristics and weather conditions.\n2.  Utilize the predicted energy output to determine an optimal operating speed for each turbine that maximizes overall wind farm energy production while minimizing wear and tear on the turbines.\n3.  Develop a control algorithm using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., control systems library, scipy) to adjust the operating parameters"
