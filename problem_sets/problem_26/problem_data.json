  "problem_statement": "Develop an algorithm that utilizes deep learning techniques to identify patterns in the topology of protein structures. Utilize a dataset provided by the Protein Data Bank (PDB) stored locally at `C:UsersUsernamePDB_Data` and train a model capable of predicting the function of newly discovered proteins based on their 3D structure.\nAssuming you have access to a high-performance computing cluster, implement your solution using Python with the TensorFlow library. Incorporate tools such as NumPy for numerical computations, SciPy for scientific functions, and Matplotlib for data visualization.\nUpon training your model, generate a report detailing:\n1. The architecture of the neural network used.\n2. The performance metrics achieved on the validation set (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n3. A 2D representation of the protein structure using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE.\nStore the results in a new folder `PDB_Analysis` located at the root directory and save any necessary files for future analysis.\nNote: This problem is highly complex due to the vastness of proteins, their diverse functions, and the difficulty of modeling 3D structures. A realistic solution would involve an enormous amount of computational resources, extensive data preprocessing, and a well-designed deep learning architecture. The complexity of this task makes it nearly impossible without significant advances in computing power or novel methodological breakthroughs. \n### File Structure\n- `PDB_Data`: folder containing the PDB dataset.\n  -"
