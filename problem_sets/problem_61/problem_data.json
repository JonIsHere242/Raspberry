  "problem_statement": "Here is a complex, open-ended problem in the science sector:\nDevelop an algorithm to classify galaxy morphologies using deep learning techniques. Given a dataset of 10,000 galaxies with their corresponding images (256x256 pixels) stored in the 'Galaxy_Images' folder and metadata (e.g., redshift, stellar mass, etc.) in the 'Galaxy_Metadata.csv' file, train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify these galaxies into one of the following categories: Spiral, Elliptical, Irregular, or Uncertain.\nThe images are stored in JPEG format and have been preprocessed by subtracting the median pixel value and dividing by 1000. The metadata includes information on the galaxy's redshift, stellar mass, and other relevant features.\nYour task is to develop a CNN architecture that can accurately classify these galaxies based on their morphological features. You should also implement techniques to handle class imbalance (since Uncertain class has fewer instances) and overfitting.\nFinally, create a new folder 'Galaxy_Classifications' with two subfolders: 'Predictions' and 'Results'. The 'Predictions' folder should contain the predicted labels for each galaxy image, while the 'Results' folder should contain a summary of the classification accuracy metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).\n**Requirements:**\n* Use Python 3.8 as the programming language.\n* Utilize the TensorFlow library for building and training the CNN model."
