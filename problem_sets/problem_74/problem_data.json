  "problem_statement": "Given the book 'Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for High-Dimensional Data' there is a section on applying Diffusion Maps to identify underlying patterns in high-dimensional data sets. Given a folder that contains files with the names of {dataset}.csv with the csv containing the columns of ID, X1, X2, ..., Xn where n represents the number of features and 'dimension.csv' file contains the true dimensionality of each dataset.\nCan you replicate the application of Diffusion Maps using the data in the 'High_Dimensional_Data' folder to identify the underlying patterns and project the high-dimensional data onto a 3D manifold? Ideally, you should use the Python library scikit-learn and create a new csv that has the ID of the data point and its corresponding coordinates on the 3D manifold called 'projected_data.csv'. \nAssume that you have access to a machine with at least 64 GB of RAM. You are also given a function `diffusion_kernel` that computes the diffusion kernel for a given dataset.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.manifold import DiffMap\nimport pandas as pd\ndef diffusion_kernel(X, n_neighbors=10):\n    # This is a placeholder function, you should implement the actual logic for computing the diffusion kernel\n    return X @ np.random.rand(*X.shape)\ndef main():\n    # Load the datasets from the folder 'High_Dimensional_Data'\n    datasets = []\n    for file in os.listdir"
