  "problem_statement": "Develop a Python program using scikit-learn library that can read data from a text file named 'stock_data.txt', which is located in the folder '/home/user/Documents/StockData'. The text file contains historical stock prices of various companies with their ticker symbol, date, and closing price.\nCreate a function called 'generate_sector_indicators' that takes as input a pandas DataFrame containing the stock data and returns a new DataFrame with additional columns for sector indicators. These indicators should include:\n    - Moving averages (MA) of 50 days and 200 days\n    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n    - Bollinger Bands\n    - Average True Range (ATR)\nThe function 'generate_sector_indicators' should be able to handle missing values in the input DataFrame. The new DataFrame with sector indicators should have the same index as the original DataFrame.\nFurthermore, write a second function called 'identify_trend_direction' that takes as input the DataFrame with sector indicators and returns a new Series containing the predicted trend direction for each stock based on its sector indicators.\nThe function 'identify_trend_direction' should use a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree classifier) to predict the trend direction. The model should be trained using a separate dataset that is stored in a CSV file named 'sector_indicators_train.csv', which is located in the folder '/home/user/Documents/StockData'.\nThe program should also create two new CSV files: one for the sector indicators ('sector_ind"
