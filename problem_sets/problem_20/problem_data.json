  "problem_statement": "Here's a complex open-ended math problem in the sector of Signal Processing:\n**Problem Statement:**\nIn the field of signal processing, a team at a leading audio engineering firm is tasked with designing an algorithm to detect and classify different types of musical genres based on spectrogram features. They have collected a dataset of 1000 songs from various genres (pop, rock, jazz, etc.) each represented by a spectrogram image.\n**Task:**\nGiven a folder `Music_Genres` containing the spectrogram images in `.jpg` format with the file names following this convention `{song_title}_{genre}.jpg`, develop a Python script that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify these songs into their respective genres. The CNN should be trained on a subset of 800 songs and tested on the remaining 200 songs.\n**Requirements:**\n- Use TensorFlow or Keras as your deep learning library.\n- Utilize pre-processing techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and resizing to enhance model performance.\n- Implement transfer learning by initializing your CNN with a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet50).\n- Train the model using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and binary cross-entropy loss function.\n- Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set and provide insights into its performance, including confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n- Finally, use the trained model to predict the genres for a new dataset"
