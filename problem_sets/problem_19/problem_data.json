You have been provided with a dataset containing the images and corresponding information about the tumors.\n### Task:\n1. **Preprocess the Images**: Load the PET scan images from the folder `/data/PET_Scans` into your Python script, then apply the following transformations:\n   - Resize all images to 256x256 pixels.\n   - Normalize pixel values between 0 and 1.\n   - Convert images to grayscale.\n2. **Extract Features**: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras with TensorFlow backend to extract features from the preprocessed images. The CNN architecture should include:\n   - Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.\n   - One fully connected layer with dropout regularization.\n   \n3. **Train the Model**: Train the model on a subset of the dataset (`/data/PET_Scans/training`) to predict tumor growth. Use mean squared error as your loss function.\n4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the performance of your model on a separate validation set (`/data/PET_Scans/validation`).\n5. **Predict Tumor Growth**: Use your trained model to make predictions on a new, unseen PET scan image stored in `/data/PET_Scans/new_scan`."
