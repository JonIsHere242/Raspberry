  "problem_statement": "A complex open-ended math sector problem is:\n\"Consider a dynamic inventory system where a retail store manages its stock levels of various products across different warehouses and distribution centers. The store receives weekly shipments of new stock, each with a specific quantity, warehouse location, and product code. The store's goal is to minimize the total cost associated with holding inventory while maintaining an optimal level of stockout risk.\nGiven a CSV file named 'Inventory_Data.csv' located in the 'Data_Storage' folder, which contains columns for Product_Code, Warehouse_ID, Quantity_Shipped, Date_Shipped, and Cost_Per_Unit, can you develop an algorithm using Python that determines the optimal inventory levels for each product at each warehouse to minimize holding costs while ensuring a target stockout risk level of 5%?\nThe CSV file contains historical data from the past year, including daily sales records for each product and warehouse. You should also account for seasonal fluctuations in demand and supply chain lead times.\nYour solution should include:\n- A detailed explanation of your algorithmic approach\n- Python code implementing the algorithm using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy\n- Visualizations to illustrate key findings and recommendations, including inventory levels, holding costs, and stockout risks at each warehouse\n- A new CSV file named 'Optimized_Inventory.csv' located in the same folder as the input data, containing the optimized inventory levels for each product at each warehouse\nAssume that the store operates 7 days a week,"
