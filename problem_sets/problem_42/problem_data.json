  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that integrates data from electronic health records (EHRs), clinical trials, and genomic data to predict patient outcomes in breast cancer patients. The system should identify high-risk patients who may benefit from targeted therapies.\nGiven a dataset of 10,000 EHRs stored in the 'patient_data.csv' file located at '/data/patient_data/', and a separate CSV file containing genomic data for each patient, named '{patient_id}_genomics.csv', stored in the '/data/genomics/' directory. The clinical trials data is available as a SQLite database stored in '/data/trials.db'.\nAssuming that you have access to the 'sklearn' and 'pandas' libraries in Python, write a code snippet that:\n1. Loads all relevant patient data from EHRs (including demographics, medical history, lab results) into a Pandas DataFrame.\n2. Extracts genomic features (e.g., mutation status, gene expression levels) for each patient and stores them in separate DataFrames.\n3. Retrieves relevant clinical trials information (trial IDs, treatment arms, participant count) from the SQLite database.\n4. Develops an ensemble machine learning model using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines to predict breast cancer recurrence probability based on the integrated data.\n5. Evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve.\n6. Identifies high-risk patients who may benefit"
