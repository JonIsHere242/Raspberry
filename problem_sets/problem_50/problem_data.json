  "problem_statement": "Develop an algorithm that models the growth patterns of a given type of tree species based on historical climate data. Utilize Python with libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.\nGiven a dataset stored in a CSV file named 'climate_data.csv', located at '/home/user/Documents/datasets/', which contains columns for:\n- Year\n- Temperature (in Celsius)\n- Precipitation (in mm)\n- Soil Moisture (%)\nand another CSV file named 'tree_growth_data.csv', located at '/home/user/Documents/datasets/', containing the following columns:\n- Tree ID\n- Year\n- Diameter (at breast height, in cm)\n- Height (in meters)\n- Biomass (in kg)\nCreate a model that predicts the diameter of trees for a given year based on historical climate data. The algorithm should account for non-linear relationships between tree growth and environmental factors.\nUse k-means clustering to group similar tree species together based on their growth patterns. Then, apply a machine learning approach, such as a random forest regressor or support vector regression, to predict the diameter of trees for a given year and climate conditions.\nOutput your results in a new CSV file named 'predicted_diameter.csv', located at '/home/user/Documents/results/', containing the predicted diameters for each tree along with their corresponding cluster labels.\nEnsure that your code is well-documented and includes necessary comments explaining your approach. Also, provide a brief description of the model's performance using metrics like mean absolute"
