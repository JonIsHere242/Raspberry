Consider a portfolio manager tasked with optimizing a mix of stocks and bonds to achieve maximum returns while minimizing risk.\nGiven a folder named \"Portfolio_Data\" containing subfolders for Stocks (e.g., \"AAPL\", \"GOOG\", etc.) and Bonds (e.g., \"US10Y\", \"GER30\", etc.), each subfolder holding csv files with daily price data (Open, High, Low, Close) for the respective asset.\nYour task is to develop a Python script using the Pandas library to:\n1. **Import Data**: Load the stock and bond price data from csv files within their respective folders.\n2. **Calculate Returns**: Compute the log returns of each asset over various time frames (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) and store them in separate data structures (pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series).\n3. **Heuristics Application**: Implement a heuristic to select the top-performing assets in each category (stocks and bonds) based on their average returns over the selected time frames.\n4. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Perform Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) to estimate the expected returns and volatility of portfolios composed of different combinations of these heuristically selected stocks and bonds.\n5. **Optimization**: Use a heuristic optimization algorithm (such as Genetic Algorithm or"
