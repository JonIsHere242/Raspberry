  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a new product launch by analyzing various social media platforms and incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Given a dataset containing tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram captions, and YouTube comments related to a company's brand, develop a deep learning model using Python with libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that can:\n1.  Extract relevant features from the text data using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.\n2.  Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional tone of the posts and comments.\n3.  Utilize time-series analysis to capture seasonal patterns in the engagement metrics.\n4.  Integrate external factors such as economic indicators, competitor activity, and industry trends.\nThe model should be able to classify new, unseen data into one of three categories: 'Likely Launch,' 'Unlikely Launch,' or 'Neutral' based on a threshold value calculated from the training dataset.\nAssume that you have access to the following datasets:\n-   **social_media_data.csv**: A CSV file containing the social media posts and comments with columns for platform, timestamp, text, sentiment score, and engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments).\n-   **economic_indicators.csv**: A CSV file with historical economic indicators such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate.\n-   **competitor_activity.csv**: A CSV file containing information about competitors' product launches and marketing campaigns.\n-   **industry_trends.csv**:"
