  "problem_statement": "Design an AI system that can analyze a large dataset of medical records stored in a database located at `path/to/medical_records.db` and predict patient outcomes based on historical data using a combination of clustering, decision trees, and support vector machines.\nGiven the complexity of medical data, consider integrating techniques from natural language processing to extract relevant information from unstructured text fields such as doctor's notes or patient complaints stored in the `notes` table. The system should output a predictive model that can be used for future patient outcomes predictions.\nThe dataset contains the following tables:\n- `patients`: with columns `patient_id`, `age`, `sex`\n- `medical_history`: with columns `patient_id`, `disease`, `treatment`\n- `lab_results`: with columns `patient_id`, `test_name`, `result`\n- `notes`: with columns `patient_id`, `note`\nThe system should be able to handle large-scale data processing and provide a high degree of accuracy in predicting patient outcomes.\nUse Python as the primary programming language, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, and NLTK or spaCy for natural language processing. Assume that you have access to a computer cluster with ample storage and computational resources.\n### Additional Requirements\n- The system should be able to handle missing values in the dataset.\n- The model should be able to explain its predictions using SHAP values or similar techniques.\n- Provide a detailed report on the performance"
