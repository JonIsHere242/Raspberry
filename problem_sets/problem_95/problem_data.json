Given a folder that contains files with the names of {city}_{time}.json with the json containing the following information:\n- `roads`: an array of road segments with their corresponding lengths and capacities\n- `traffic_signals`: an array of traffic signals with their corresponding timings and locations\n- `av_locations`: an array of current AV positions, speeds, and headings\n- `demand_points`: an array of demand points (e.g. pick-up/drop-off points) with their corresponding coordinates and timestamps\nCan you replicate the reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal scheduling of AVs in dynamic traffic environments using the data in the 'Traffic_Data' folder? Ideally, you should implement a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to learn an optimal policy that minimizes travel time and energy consumption.\n**Assumptions:**\n- The city is modeled as a graph with road segments as nodes and intersections as edges\n- AVs are equipped with sensors for real-time traffic information\n- Demand points have static coordinates but dynamic timestamps (e.g. time of day, day of week)\n**Output:**\n- Train the DDPG agent using 90% of the data in 'Traffic_Data' folder and evaluate its performance on the remaining 10"
