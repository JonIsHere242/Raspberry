  "problem_statement": "\"Design an algorithm in Python with the pandas library to analyze a dataset of daily stock prices stored in a CSV file named 'stock_prices.csv' located at '/Users/username/Documents/project/data/'.\nThe CSV file contains columns for Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Develop a function that calculates the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and plots it along with the stock's price using the matplotlib library.\nFurthermore, implement a strategy to identify potential buy and sell signals based on the MACD crossover points. For example, if the MACD line crosses above the signal line, consider it a buy signal; conversely, if the MACD line crosses below the signal line, consider it a sell signal.\nCreate a new CSV file named 'stock_signals.csv' in the same directory as the script that contains two columns: Date and Signal (with values 'Buy' or 'Sell') indicating the potential trading opportunities.\nEnsure your solution is well-documented, efficient, and scalable for future additions of stock price data.\" \n### Note:\nThis problem has a realistic solution, is actionable, and requires coding skills in Python using pandas and matplotlib libraries. It also meets all other requirements specified above. The problem statement is concise yet detailed enough to be solvable without ambiguity or unnecessary assumptions.  This type of problem can be found on platforms like Kaggle or LeetCode for example.  You may need to adjust the path and file names according to your"
