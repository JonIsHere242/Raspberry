  "problem_statement": "Design an AI system that can analyze medical imaging data from MRI and CT scans of patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. The goal is to identify tumors based on their texture and shape features extracted from the images.\nThe system should be able to:\n1. Preprocess the images by applying filters to remove noise and artifacts.\n2. Extract relevant features from the images using techniques such as Gabor filtering, Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Fractal analysis.\n3. Use a deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify the tumors into different stages of malignancy based on their feature vectors.\n4. Develop a user-friendly interface for radiologists to input patient information, view image slices, and receive classification results with confidence scores.\n5. Integrate with an existing electronic health record (EHR) system to retrieve relevant patient data and store the AI-generated reports.\nThe dataset used should be the TCIA's LGG (Low-Grade Glioma) collection, which contains MRI and CT scans of patients with glioblastoma.\n**Required Deliverables:**\n* A Python notebook or Jupyter file that demonstrates the preprocessing and feature extraction steps using OpenCV and scikit-image libraries.\n* A PyTorch or TensorFlow implementation of the CNN model for classification.\n* A user interface design concept, preferably in HTML/CSS/JS, that meets the requirements specified above.\n* A brief report on how to integrate the AI system with"
