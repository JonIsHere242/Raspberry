  "problem_statement": "Here's a complex open-ended problem in the heuristics sector:\n**Problem:** \nIn the field of Reinforcement Learning, there is an ongoing debate about how to effectively balance exploration and exploitation in complex environments. A common approach is to use Upper Confidence bound Applied to Trees (UCT) algorithms, which have been successfully applied to various domains.\nGiven a complex environment represented by a tree-like graph data structure, with nodes representing states and edges representing actions, can you implement an extension of the UCT algorithm that incorporates heuristics from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to handle large action spaces? The goal is to optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off in this environment.\n**Input:**\n*   A folder containing a file `environment_graph.csv` with the graph structure, where each row represents a node with attributes 'node_id', 'parent_node_id' (for non-root nodes), and 'action_space_size'.\n*   Another file `heuristics.csv` with precomputed heuristics for each state, including estimated rewards, action costs, and an estimate of the environment's difficulty.\n*   A Python library `networkx` to handle graph operations.\n**Objective:**\nImplement a UCT-MCTS algorithm that efficiently balances exploration and exploitation in this complex environment. The solution should:\n1.  Load the environment graph from `environment_graph.csv`.\n2.  Compute an initial heuristic evaluation for each node using the data from `heuristics.csv`.\n3"
