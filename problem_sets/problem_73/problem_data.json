  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that forecasts the likelihood of a new species being discovered in a given region based on historical data from the 'SpeciesDiscoveryDatabase.csv' file, which contains columns for geographical location (Latitude and Longitude), environmental conditions (Temperature, Humidity, and Precipitation), and historical discovery counts. The model should integrate both spatial and temporal factors using a deep learning approach.\nUtilize Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries and incorporate the following:\n1.  **Spatial Autoregression**: Use a spatial autoregression model to account for regional patterns in species discovery.\n2.  **Temporal Analysis**: Incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in historical data.\n3.  **Deep Learning Integration**: Combine the spatial and temporal components using a deep learning architecture, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), to learn complex relationships between geographical location, environmental conditions, and discovery likelihood.\n4.  **Uncertainty Quantification**: Implement Bayesian neural networks or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify the uncertainty in the model's predictions.\nOutput:\n*   A Python script (`species_discovery_model.py`) that trains and evaluates the model using the provided dataset (`SpeciesDiscoveryDatabase.csv`).\n*   A CSV file (`new_species_likelihoods.csv`) containing the predicted likelihood of discovering a new species in each region, along with the corresponding geographical location"
