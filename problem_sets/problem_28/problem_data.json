  "problem_statement": "Generate a complex, open-ended problem in the factual sector, similar in structure and conciseness to this example:\n\"Develop an algorithm using Python and its relevant libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas) to classify historical stock prices into different market regimes based on their Bollinger Bands. Given a folder named 'Market_Data' containing CSV files with the names of {company}.csv where each csv contains Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume columns, create an executable script that outputs a new CSV file named 'regime_classification.csv' where each row represents a company-stock combination and its corresponding market regime classification. The algorithm should consider both short-term and long-term moving averages for Bollinger Bands calculations and utilize a decision tree classifier to predict the market regimes (e.g., uptrend, downtrend, consolidation). Ensure that the script can handle missing values, outliers, and different stock price scales.\"  ### Solution: \nHere is a possible solution in Python:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n# Load data from CSV files into a DataFrame\ndef load_data(file_path):\n    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n    return df\n# Calculate Bollinger Bands\ndef calculate_bollinger_bands(df, window_short, window_long):\n    df['MA_Short'] = df['Close'].rolling(window="
