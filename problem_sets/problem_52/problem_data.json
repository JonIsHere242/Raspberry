You have been tasked with predicting customer churn based on purchase history and demographic information.\nYou have a dataset stored in the 'customer_data.csv' file located in the '/data/ecommerce/' folder, which contains the following columns:\n- Customer ID\n- Purchase History (a list of dates and product IDs)\n- Age\n- Gender\n- Income Level\nYour task is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn within the next 6 months. You should use a supervised learning approach and a relevant algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).\nCreate a new Python script called 'customer_churn_model.py' in the '/src/models/' folder that performs the following tasks:\n1. Load the customer data from the 'customer_data.csv' file.\n2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, income level).\n3. Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).\n4. Train a predictive model using the preprocessed data.\n5. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n6. Save the trained model to a file called 'customer_churn_model.pkl' in the '/src/models/' folder.\n7. Use the trained model to predict customer churn for new data stored in the '"
