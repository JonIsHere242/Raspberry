  "problem_statement": "A company that specializes in analyzing consumer behavior wants you to develop a predictive model that can forecast sales of different products across various channels (online, offline, and mobile) based on historical data. The goal is to identify the most influential factors driving sales and make informed decisions about resource allocation.\nGiven a folder named 'Sales_Data' containing files with the names of {product}.csv with the csv containing the columns of Date, Channel (Online, Offline, Mobile), Sales_Amount, Marketing_Costs, Store_Location, Seasonality (1 = Winter, 2 = Spring, etc.), and Product_Category. The company is interested in replicating a regression model that can predict sales across different channels using the provided data.\nCan you develop a predictive model to forecast sales of various products based on historical data? Ideally, you should:\n- Identify the most influential factors driving sales\n- Develop a regression model that can accurately predict sales across different channels\n- Create a new csv called 'forecasted_sales.csv' with the predicted sales amount for each product and channel\nAssume you will be using Python as the primary language and pandas, numpy, scikit-learn libraries. You should also include any relevant code or formulas used in your solution.\n### Solution:\n**Problem Statement:**\nA company that specializes in analyzing consumer behavior wants you to develop a predictive model that can forecast sales of different products across various channels (online, offline, and mobile) based on historical data.\nGiven a folder named '"
