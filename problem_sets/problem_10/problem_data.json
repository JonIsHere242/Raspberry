Given a folder that contains files with the names of {company}.csv with the csv containing the columns of 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume' and 'SMA50' which is the 50-day Simple Moving Average, can you replicate the LSTM model using the data in the 'Stock_Prediction' folder to predict the stock prices for the next 30 days? \nAssuming a fixed window size of 120 trading days, create an LSTM network that takes into account both past stock prices and their moving averages. You should use the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend and implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.\nAlso, include a section in your code to plot the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices using Matplotlib.\nYou can assume that the data is stored in the 'Data' folder which contains subfolders for each company. The folder structure should be as follows:\n```\nStock_Prediction\n|--- Data\n    |--- Apple\n    |       |--- apple.csv\n    |--- Google\n    |       |--- google.csv\n    |--- Amazon\n    |       |--- amazon.csv\n```\nThe csv files contain the historical stock prices for each company.
