Given a dataset of ICU patients, including demographic information (age, sex), laboratory results (creatinine levels, urine output), and clinical data (diagnosis codes, medications), predict the likelihood of AKI within a 24-hour window.\n**Dataset:**\nThe dataset is stored in a CSV file named \"icu_data.csv\" located at \"/home/medics/datasets/\". The file contains the following columns:\n- patient_id\n- age\n- sex (M/F)\n- creatinine_level\n- urine_output\n- diagnosis_codes (e.g., ICD-10 codes)\n- medications\n- admission_time\n**Task:**\n1. Import the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning.\n2. Load the dataset from the specified CSV file using pandas' `read_csv()` function.\n3. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (sex, diagnosis codes), and scaling numerical features (age, creatinine level, urine output).\n4. Split the preprocessed data into training (~70%) and testing sets (~30%).\n5. Develop a predictive model using a suitable algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest) to predict AKI within 24 hours.\n6. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such"
