Assume you have access to a dataset containing patient records, including demographic information (age, sex), laboratory results (eGFR, serum creatinine), and medication history.\nGiven a folder named 'Heart_Failure_Data' containing CSV files for each patient, where each file has the following structure:\n- PatientID (unique identifier)\n- Age\n- Sex (male/female)\n- eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate)\n- Serum Creatinine\n- Medication History (list of medications taken by the patient)\nCreate a predictive model that can classify patients into high-risk and low-risk categories based on their likelihood of developing heart failure. The model should be trained using 80% of the data and validated on the remaining 20%. Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.\nYour task is to:\n1. Import the necessary libraries.\n2. Load the dataset from the 'Heart_Failure_Data' folder.\n3. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling/normalizing features as needed, and encoding categorical variables.\n4. Split the data into training and validation sets (80% for training and 20% for validation).\n5. Develop a predictive model using a suitable algorithm (e.g.,"
