  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can predict patient readmission rates based on historical data from electronic health records (EHRs) in a hospital setting. The dataset includes:\n- Demographic information: age, sex, marital status\n- Medical history: previous diagnoses, surgeries, medications\n- Clinical data: vital signs, lab results, treatment plans\n- Social determinants of health: insurance status, housing stability, education level\nThe goal is to create a predictive model that identifies patients at high risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge. The system should be able to:\n1. Handle missing values and outliers in the data.\n2. Perform feature engineering to select relevant variables for prediction.\n3. Train a machine learning model (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) on the preprocessed data.\n4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.\n5. Provide an interpretability report that explains the contribution of each feature to the prediction.\nThe system should be able to handle a large dataset with millions of rows and thousands of columns. The solution should include:\n- A detailed description of the data preprocessing steps\n- Code snippets in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data visualization\n- Explanation of the feature engineering process\n- Results from the machine learning model training and evaluation\n- Interpretability report with feature importance scores\nThe system should"
