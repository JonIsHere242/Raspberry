  "problem_statement": "In the book 'Advances in Artificial General Intelligence' there is a section on using evolutionary algorithms to optimize the parameters of cognitive architectures. Given a dataset of 1000 human brain scans, where each scan has 500 features (e.g., signal intensity in different regions), and the goal is to develop an AGI that can learn from these scans and perform tasks such as object recognition and navigation.\nDevelop an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes the parameters of a cognitive architecture inspired by the neural networks found in the human brain. The architecture should be capable of learning from the brain scan data and achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark tasks for object recognition (e.g., ImageNet) and navigation (e.g., the \"Room-to-Room\" navigation task).\nThe algorithm should use a population size of 1000, with each individual being a set of parameters for the cognitive architecture. The fitness function should evaluate the performance of each individual on the benchmark tasks.\nThe code should be implemented in Python using the PyTorch library and the DEAP evolutionary computation framework. The dataset of brain scans is stored in the 'Brain_Scans' folder, with each file being a '.npz' archive containing the 500 features for that scan.\nCreate a new directory called 'AGI_Project' to hold all the code and data, and create two csv files: 'object_recognition_results.csv' and 'navigation_results.csv', where each row represents the performance of an individual on one"
