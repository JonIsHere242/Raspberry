  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can analyze satellite imagery to identify patterns of land degradation in Africa, particularly focusing on areas with high population density and agricultural activity. The system should integrate data from various sources, including NASA's Landsat 8 satellite imagery, the African Soil Information System (AfSIS), and the FAO's Global Agro-Hydrological Information Systems (AGROVOC). It should use machine learning algorithms to classify areas of land degradation into different categories based on severity.\nThe system should be capable of processing large datasets from various sources, including satellite imagery, climate data, soil type information, and agricultural production data. It must also integrate with existing systems for monitoring and managing natural resources.\nKey requirements:\n- Integrate Landsat 8 satellite imagery with AfSIS and AGROVOC databases to identify areas of land degradation.\n- Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to classify land degradation severity levels based on spectral analysis of satellite images and other environmental factors.\n- Process large datasets from multiple sources using efficient algorithms and data storage solutions.\n- Integrate with existing systems for monitoring and managing natural resources, such as the African Union's African Soil Information System (AfSIS) or national-level agricultural information systems.\nSystem specifications:\n* Language: Python\n* Libraries/Frameworks:\n\t+ Geospatial libraries like GDAL and Fiona for satellite image processing\n\t+ Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms\n\t+ Pandas and Num"
