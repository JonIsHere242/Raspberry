Utilizing a dataset of MRI scans (e.g., from the \"BRATS\" challenge), train and evaluate a model capable of segmenting glioblastoma tumors in brain images.\nGiven a directory containing MRI scan files stored as DICOM format, your task is to:\n- Load and preprocess the DICOM images using libraries such as `pydicom` or `dcm` for reading and converting the data.\n- Apply necessary image processing techniques (e.g., normalization, filtering) to enhance the quality of the images.\n- Utilize a machine learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop a segmentation model that can identify glioblastoma tumors in the preprocessed images.\n- Train the model using a labeled dataset where each MRI scan is annotated with its corresponding tumor regions.\n- Evaluate the performance of your model on unseen data, assessing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score for the segmentation task.\nYour solution should include:\n* A detailed explanation of the preprocessing steps applied to the DICOM images\n* Code snippets illustrating how you load and preprocess the MRI scans\n* Implementation details of the machine learning model used for tumor segmentation\n* Results from evaluating your model on a test dataset, including any visualizations or metrics that demonstrate its performance\nAssume you have access to a directory named `/path/to/MRI/scans` containing the DICOM files. Save your final code in a file called `"
