  "problem_statement": "Design an AI system that can predict and forecast population growth in different regions of the world based on historical demographic data, climate patterns, urbanization trends, and economic indicators.\n**Data Availability:**\nThe necessary data is stored in a database located at `/path/to/demographic_data.db` and includes:\n- Historical population counts for various countries from 1950 to 2022\n- Climate patterns (temperature, precipitation, etc.) for different regions\n- Urbanization trends (rate of urbanization, rural-urban migration)\n- Economic indicators (GDP per capita, inflation rate, etc.)\n**Goals:**\n1. **Population Growth Forecasting:** Train a machine learning model that can predict population growth rates for the next 20 years based on historical data and other influencing factors.\n2. **Regional Analysis:** Develop an AI system that can analyze population growth trends across different regions of the world (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific).\n3. **Influencing Factors Analysis:** Investigate how climate patterns, urbanization trends, and economic indicators impact population growth rates.\n**Deliverables:**\n1. A Python script (`forecast_population_growth.py`) that uses historical data to train a machine learning model to predict population growth rates.\n2. An R script (`regional_analysis.R`) that analyzes population growth trends across different regions of the world using the trained model.\n3. A report (`population_growth_report.pdf`) detailing your findings on how climate patterns, urbanization"
