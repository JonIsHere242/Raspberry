  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model to predict the structural integrity of bridges under various environmental conditions using a dataset from the Bridge Structural Integrity Dataset (BSID) available at `https://github.com/datasets/bridge-structural-integrity`. The dataset includes information on bridge geometry, materials, and environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and traffic load.\n**Objective:**\nDesign an AI model that can accurately predict whether a bridge will fail under different environmental conditions. The model should be able to handle missing data, outliers, and non-linear relationships between variables.\n**Dataset:**\n*   Bridge Geometry: length, width, height, number of spans\n*   Materials: type (steel, concrete), age, condition\n*   Environmental Factors:\n    *   Temperature (\u00b0C)\n    *   Humidity (%)\n    *   Wind Speed (m/s)\n    *   Traffic Load (kg/m\u00b2)\n**Requirements:**\n1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data using imputation techniques and remove outliers based on statistical methods.\n2.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that capture non-linear relationships between variables, such as polynomial transformations of temperature and wind speed.\n3.  **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks) to predict bridge failure.\n4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to optimize model performance.\n5.  **Model Evaluation:**"
