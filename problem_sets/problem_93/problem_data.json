The goal is to minimize congestion and maximize the number of passengers transported within a specified time frame.\nYou have been provided with:\n- A folder (`urban_traffic_data`) containing historical traffic data in CSV format, where each file represents a day's worth of traffic data for a specific road segment (`road_segment.csv`).\n- A set of autonomous vehicles' current positions and destinations stored in a JSON file (`av_positions.json`).\n- The urban environment's map data as an ESRI shapefile (`urban_map.shp`) containing information about the roads, intersections, and pedestrian zones.\nYour task is to:\n1. **Integrate the traffic data**: Load the historical traffic data from the `urban_traffic_data` folder into a Pandas dataframe, ensuring that each day's data is properly aligned with its respective road segment.\n2. **Implement dynamic programming**: Develop a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the optimal route for each autonomous vehicle based on the current traffic conditions and the urban map data.\n3. **Account for pedestrian zones and real-time updates**: Modify the algorithm to consider pedestrian zones as areas of high priority, while also incorporating real-time updates from sensors (e.g., traffic cameras, lidar) stored in a"
