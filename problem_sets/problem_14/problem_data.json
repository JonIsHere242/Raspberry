  "problem_statement": "Develop an algorithm that uses a combination of numerical methods and linear algebra to solve a 3D surface reconstruction from incomplete and noisy point cloud data. \nGiven a folder named 'PointCloud_Data' containing files with names in the format {sceneID}_points.csv where each csv file contains columns of X, Y, Z coordinates representing points on a 3D surface. The sceneIDs are integers ranging from 1 to 10.\nSome points are missing or have noise and you need to write a Python script that uses libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to:\n- Read the CSV files in the 'PointCloud_Data' folder\n- Filter out noisy points using a statistical method (e.g., IQR or Z-score) and remove points with missing values\n- Apply a surface reconstruction algorithm such as Poisson Surface Reconstruction or Delaunay Triangulation to reconstruct the 3D surface from the filtered point cloud data\n- Visualize the reconstructed surface using Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities and save the plots in a new folder named 'Reconstructed_Surfaces'\n- Output the reconstructed surface as a set of vertices and triangles in a new CSV file called 'reconstructed_surface.csv'\nUse the following Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Ensure your solution handles edge cases such as empty or malformed input files.\nFile paths:\n- Input data folder: '/Users/username/Documents/PointCloud_Data'\n- Output plots folder:"
