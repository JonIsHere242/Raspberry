  "problem_statement": "Develop a predictive model that can forecast the probability of an Alzheimer's patient responding favorably to immunotherapy based on their clinical, demographic, and genomic data.\n**Given:**\n- A folder named `/patient_data` containing CSV files with the names of patients (`Patient_ID.csv`) each having columns for `Age`, `Gender`, `Genetic_Markers`, `Clinical_Symptoms`, and `Treatment_History`.\n- A text file `/genomics.txt` containing a list of gene variants associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n- A CSV file `/alzheimers_dataset.csv` containing the clinical trial data of patients who received immunotherapy, including their response (favorable or unfavorable).\n**Task:**\n1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the patient data by handling missing values, normalizing categorical variables, and converting genetic markers into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data that can be used to predict the response to immunotherapy. This may include creating new variables based on the clinical symptoms, treatment history, age, gender, and genomic data.\n3. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose a suitable predictive model (e.g., decision tree, random forest, neural network) and train it using the preprocessed feature set and the response variable from the alzheimers_dataset.csv file.\n4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the chosen model on the training"
