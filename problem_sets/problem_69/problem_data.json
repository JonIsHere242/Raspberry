  "problem_statement": "Create a complex, open-ended problem in the coding sector:\n**Problem:**\nReplicate the analysis from the paper \"Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning\" by Zoph and Le (2017) using the Keras library in Python. Given the folder that contains files with the names of {model_name}.h5 with the h5 file containing the layers and weights of a neural network model, can you:\n*   Implement a custom reinforcement learning algorithm to search for the optimal architecture among the given models\n*   Train each model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the TensorFlow backend\n*   Evaluate the performance of each model by calculating its top-1 accuracy on the test set\n*   Visualize the evolution of the optimal architecture over time using a heatmap or scatter plot\n**Specific Requirements:**\n*   Use Keras with TensorFlow as the backend\n*   Utilize the `keras.utils.Sequence` class to create data generators for training and validation\n*   Implement a custom reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Q-learning or SARSA\n*   Use the `keras.models.load_model` function to load pre-trained models from the {model_name}.h5 files\n**File Paths:**\n*   Assume that the folder containing the model files is located at `/path/to/models/`\n*   The CIFAR-10 dataset is stored in the `/path/to/cifar10/` directory\n*   The results should be saved to a new folder named"
