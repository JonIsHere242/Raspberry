(AAPL) based on its historical stock prices and other relevant technical indicators such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and Money Flow Index.\nGiven a folder containing files with the names of {ticker}.csv with the csv containing the columns of Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume. Your task is to:\n1. Load the historical stock price data for AAPL from the 'AAPL_Stock_Data.csv' file in the 'Historical_Stock_Prices' folder.\n2. Calculate the Moving Averages (MA) with periods 50 and 200 using the pandas library's rolling function.\n3. Compute the Relative Strength Index (RSI) using a 14-period window.\n4. Create Bollinger Bands based on the 20-period MA and 2 standard deviations.\n5. Calculate the Money Flow Index (MFI).\n6. Use these technical indicators to train a machine learning model, such as an LSTM or ARIMA, to predict future stock prices for AAPL.\n7. Save the predicted stock prices in a new csv file called 'AAPL_Predicted_Stock_Prices.csv' in the 'Predictions' folder.\nNote: You may need to use other libraries like yfinance, mplfinance, or statsmodels to fetch or"
