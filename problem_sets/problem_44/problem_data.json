  "problem_statement": "Develop a mathematical model that simulates the behavior of a nonlinear system with two state variables and one control variable using the Lotka-Volterra equations. The model should account for changes in population dynamics due to environmental factors.\nGiven a Python library called `scipy` and an existing dataset stored in the 'Population_Data.csv' file located at '/Users/user/Documents/Data/Population_Data.csv', create a function that:\n*   Loads the dataset\n*   Fits the Lotka-Volterra model to the data using the least squares method\n*   Simulates the system behavior over a range of time points (t = 0 to t = 100)\n*   Plots the state variables and control variable as functions of time\nThe 'Population_Data.csv' file contains columns for 'Time', 'Predator_Population', and 'Prey_Population'. The model should be able to capture the oscillatory behavior of the system.\nCreate a new Python script called 'lotka_volterra_model.py' in the '/Users/user/Documents/Code/' directory that implements this functionality. Ensure that the script is well-documented with comments explaining each section of code. Use descriptive variable names and adhere to PEP 8 coding conventions.\nThe output should be a plot showing the behavior of the system over time, including the predator population, prey population, and control variable as functions of time. The plot should be saved in the '/Users/user/Documents/Plots/' directory with the filename"
