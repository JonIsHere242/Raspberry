Given a dataset of 10,000 MRI images in the 'MRI_Data' folder, organized by patient ID and scan date in subfolders as '{patient_id}/{scan_date}/image.nii.gz', where each .nii.gz file represents a single 3D MRI image.\nThe dataset contains several types of medical imaging modalities including T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W), and Proton Density (PD) images. The task is to train a deep learning model using the Keras library in Python that can predict patient outcomes such as survival rate, disease progression, or treatment response based on these imaging features.\nThe model should be able to handle variable-length 3D image inputs, extract relevant features, and make accurate predictions. You are given access to a separate folder 'patient_outcomes' containing CSV files with the patient outcome labels for each MRI scan in the format 'patient_id,scan_date,outcome'.\nYour solution should:\n1. Load the MRI data from the 'MRI_Data' folder into a Keras-compatible format.\n2. Preprocess the images by normalizing pixel values and applying any necessary transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping).\n3. Define a deep neural network architecture using Keras that can learn spatial hierarchies of features from the 3D image inputs.\n4. Train the model on the preprocessed data, using a"
