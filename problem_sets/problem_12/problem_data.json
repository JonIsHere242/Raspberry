The goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast patient outcomes based on these EHRs.\nGiven the folder containing EHR files named after patient IDs in the format {patientID}.csv with the following columns:\n- Patient ID (unique identifier)\n- Gender\n- Age\n- Medical History (a binary variable indicating presence/absence of specific conditions)\n- Medications (a list of medications prescribed to the patient)\n- Lab Results (numerical values for various lab tests)\n- Treatment Outcomes (categorical outcome - e.g., recovery, relapse, etc.)\nCan you use a combination of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques in Python with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to:\n1. Clean and preprocess the EHR data.\n2. Perform feature engineering by extracting relevant features from the Lab Results column (e.g., mean, standard deviation, etc.).\n3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n4. Train a predictive model using a suitable algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) to predict patient outcomes based on their EHR data.\n5. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)."
