  "problem_statement": "Design an AI system capable of predicting patient outcomes in a clinical trial by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques.\n**Given:**\n- A folder named `Clinical_Trials_Data` containing text files (`patient_notes.txt`, `lab_results.txt`) with patient data, including notes from doctors and lab results.\n- A CSV file named `demographics.csv` with basic information about patients (age, gender, medical history).\n- Another CSV file named `outcome_data.csv` containing the actual outcomes of the clinical trial (disease progression, survival rates).\n**Objective:**\nImplement a machine learning pipeline in Python using libraries such as scikit-learn and NLTK to predict patient outcomes based on their notes, lab results, demographics, and historical data.\n**Requirements:**\n1. **Text Preprocessing:** Use techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and named entity recognition to clean the text data from `patient_notes.txt` and extract relevant information.\n2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec), and topic modeling.\n3. **Data Integration:** Integrate the extracted features with the numerical data from `lab_results.txt`, `demographics.csv`, and `outcome_data.csv`.\n4. **Model Selection:** Train a machine learning model using the integrated dataset to predict patient outcomes (disease progression, survival rates).\n5. **Hyperparameter Tuning"
