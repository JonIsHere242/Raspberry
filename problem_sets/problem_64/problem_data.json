  "problem_statement": "Develop a Python script using the Scikit-learn library that extracts features from a dataset of tweets related to climate change, then trains and evaluates a random forest classifier on these features to predict whether a tweet is about climate change or not. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named 'tweets.csv' located at '/home/user/Downloads/datasets/tweets'.\nThe CSV file has the following structure:\n- `id`: A unique identifier for each tweet\n- `text`: The text of the tweet\n- `label`: Whether the tweet is about climate change (1) or not (0)\nYour task is to:\n1. Preprocess the text data by removing stop words, lemmatizing words, and converting all text to lowercase.\n2. Extract features from the preprocessed text using a combination of techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings (Word2Vec).\n3. Train a random forest classifier on these features to predict whether a tweet is about climate change or not.\n4. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n5. Save the trained model and its evaluation metrics in separate CSV files named 'model.csv' and 'evaluation_metrics.csv', respectively.\nAssume that you have the necessary libraries installed, including Scikit-learn and NLTK for text preprocessing.\nThe goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify tweets about climate change from those that are not."
