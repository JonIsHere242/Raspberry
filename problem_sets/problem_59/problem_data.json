They have a large fleet of electric vehicles and a logistics system that needs to be optimized daily based on demand, traffic patterns, and vehicle availability.\n#### Problem Statement\nYou need to develop a heuristic algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization) to determine the most efficient routes for their delivery vans in real-time. The goal is to minimize fuel consumption while ensuring all packages are delivered within a 3-hour window.\n#### Data Availability\n- A CSV file (`fleet_data.csv`) containing information about each vehicle:\n    - `Vehicle_ID` (unique identifier)\n    - `Battery_Level` (%)\n    - `Current_Location` (latitude and longitude)\n    - `Available_Driver`\n- Another CSV file (`package_requests.csv`) with all package pickups and drop-offs for the day, including:\n    - `Package_ID`\n    - `Pickup_Location` (latitude and longitude)\n    - `Dropoff_Location` (latitude and longitude)\n    - `Priority_Level` (high/medium/low)\n#### Requirements\n1. **Route Optimization**: Develop a heuristic algorithm to generate routes for each vehicle that minimize fuel consumption, taking into account the current locations of vehicles and drivers, traffic patterns (available through an API), and package priority levels.\n2. **Real-time Updates**:"
