  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that predicts the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis within 24 hours based on their Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including lab results, medication orders, and vital signs.\nGiven a folder containing EHR data in CSV files named after the patient's Medical Record Number (MRN), e.g., \"MRN_12345.csv\", where each file contains the following columns:\n- Date\n- Time\n- Vital Signs: Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR)\n- Lab Results: White Blood Cell Count (WBC), Platelet Count, Creatinine Level\n- Medication Orders: Antibiotics, Vasopressors\n- Other Relevant Data: Temperature, Oxygen Saturation\nUsing Python with the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) and a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, design an AI system that:\n1. Cleans and preprocesses the EHR data, handling missing values and outliers.\n2. Extracts relevant features from the preprocessed data using techniques such as feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).\n3. Trains a predictive model on the extracted features to predict the likelihood of sepsis within 24 hours. Consider using machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or neural networks.\n4. Evaluates the performance of the predictive model using metrics such as AUC-ROC and accuracy.\n5.
