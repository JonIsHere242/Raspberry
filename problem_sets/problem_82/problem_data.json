  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI model that can predict the likelihood of a new material exhibiting superconductivity based on its crystal structure, atomic composition, and thermal properties.\nGiven a database folder 'Superconductor_Data' containing files with names in the format '{material_id}.csv', where each csv file contains columns for:\n- Atomic Composition (elements and their percentages)\n- Crystal Structure (space group, lattice parameters, etc.)\n- Thermal Properties (heat capacity, thermal conductivity, specific heat ratio)\nUsing a Python environment with libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and tensorflow, write an AI model that can predict the likelihood of a new material exhibiting superconductivity based on its characteristics.\nThe model should be trained on a subset of 500 materials from the database and then used to predict the likelihood for all remaining materials in the database. The predicted probabilities should be outputted to a csv file called 'superconductor_likelihoods.csv' with columns for Material ID, Predicted Probability of Superconductivity, and Confidence Interval.\nAdditionally, visualize the performance of the model using a confusion matrix and a ROC curve. Plot the results using matplotlib.\n### Hint:\nTo solve this problem you can use techniques such as feature engineering (e.g., calculating ratios between atomic percentages), dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or t-SNE), and ensemble methods (e.g., random forest or gradient boosting). You may also want to consider using transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or Res"
