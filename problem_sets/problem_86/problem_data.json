  "problem_statement": "Develop an algorithm in Python using the NumPy library to solve the following complex math problem:\nGiven a large dataset of 3D point cloud data stored in a CSV file named 'point_cloud_data.csv', located at '/path/to/project/data/', where each row represents a 3D point with x, y, and z coordinates, find the optimal rigid transformation (translation, rotation) that aligns this point cloud with another known point cloud stored in a separate CSV file named 'reference_point_cloud.csv' also located within the same directory.\nThe reference point cloud has undergone an unknown rigid transformation and is now stored in a different coordinate system. The task involves using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the optimal alignment of these two clouds, taking into account any possible scale factors between them.\nAfter finding this optimal transformation matrix, apply it to the original point cloud data and output the transformed points in a new CSV file named 'aligned_point_cloud.csv', also located within the '/path/to/project/data/' directory.\nThe problem requires utilizing NumPy for array operations and possibly leveraging libraries such as SciPy or scikit-image for PCA functionality. Ensure that your Python script includes comments explaining each step of the process, as this is a complex mathematical task requiring clarity in implementation details.\n### Constraints:\n- The point cloud data files are too large to fit into memory, so you must implement an efficient method for processing them in chunks.\n- You should handle any potential errors related to reading CSV files or performing PCA"
