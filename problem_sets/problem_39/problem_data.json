  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can generate realistic virtual humans using a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Physically Based Rendering (PBR). The system should be able to create detailed 3D models of human faces, bodies, and accessories, and then animate them in real-time using keyframe animation or physics-based simulations.\nGiven a folder that contains a set of reference images of humans with different skin tones, hair textures, and body types, as well as a library of clothes and accessories, can you train the AI system to generate realistic virtual humans that match the diversity of the reference images?\nThe system should be able to:\n1. Extract features from the reference images using techniques such as deep learning-based feature extraction or SIFT.\n2. Use these features to create 3D models of human faces and bodies, including skin texture, hair texture, and body shape.\n3. Generate detailed accessories such as clothing, jewelry, and hats that match the style and era of the reference images.\n4. Animate the virtual humans using keyframe animation or physics-based simulations, such as cloth simulation or rigid body dynamics.\nThe AI system should be able to generate at least 10 different virtual humans per hour, each with their own unique appearance and accessories. The system should also be able to adapt to new reference images and styles without requiring extensive retraining.\nPlease use Python as the primary programming language, along with libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning,"
