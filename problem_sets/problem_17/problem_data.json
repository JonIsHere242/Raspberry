  "problem_statement": "Develop an optimization model in Python using PuLP library that minimizes the total cost of a logistics network with multiple warehouses, distribution centers, and customer locations. The model should include:\n1.  **Warehouse Location Problem:** Determine the optimal location of warehouses to minimize transportation costs between warehouses and distribution centers.\n2.  **Distribution Center Location Problem:** Choose the distribution centers among potential sites considering their proximity to customers, warehouse locations, and capacity constraints.\n3.  **Route Optimization:** For each customer, find the most cost-effective route from one or more distribution centers that can serve them.\n4.  **Inventory Management:** Balance inventory levels across warehouses and distribution centers to minimize stockouts and overstocking costs while considering lead times and demand fluctuations.\n5.  **Scenario Analysis:** Implement a scenario analysis module to evaluate how changes in key parameters (e.g., fuel prices, demand growth) affect the logistics network's efficiency and identify potential cost savings opportunities.\nUse the following data:\n-   Warehouse locations: `warehouses.csv` with columns for warehouse ID, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), capacity, and fixed costs.\n-   Potential distribution center sites: `potential_dcs.csv` with columns for site ID, location coordinates, capacity, and fixed costs.\n-   Customer locations and demand: `customers.csv` with columns for customer ID, location coordinates, annual demand, and service level requirements.\n-   Transportation costs (distance-based): `transportation_costs.csv` with columns for origin"
