  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI-driven system that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the allocation of resources in a complex network of renewable energy sources. The goal is to maximize the overall energy output while minimizing costs and environmental impact.\n**Problem Statement**\nYou are given a folder `Renewable_Energy_Network` containing files with the names of `{region}.csv`, where each file represents a geographical region and contains data on:\n- `Date`\n- `Solar_Panel_Count`\n- `Wind_Turbine_Count`\n- `Hydro_Power_Plant_Count`\n- `Battery_Size`\n- `Energy_Demand`\nAdditionally, you have access to a database `Energy_Source_Characteristics` containing information on the efficiency and environmental impact of each energy source.\n**Objective**\nUsing reinforcement learning, design an AI system that optimizes the allocation of resources across different regions and energy sources to maximize overall energy output while minimizing costs and environmental impact. The system should:\n1.  Initialize a population of candidate solutions (energy allocations) for each region.\n2.  Evaluate the fitness of each solution using a combination of metrics, including:\n    *   Energy output\n    *   Cost\n    *   Environmental impact\n3.  Apply reinforcement learning algorithms to select and modify the best-performing solutions in each iteration.\n4.  Update the population with new candidate solutions based on the RL-driven selection process.\n5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of iterations or until convergence is reached"
