  "problem_statement": "Develop a Python script that uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews from an e-commerce company's database. The reviews are stored in a PostgreSQL database with the following table schema:\n- Table name: `customer_reviews`\n- Columns:\n  - `review_id` (primary key, integer)\n  - `customer_name` (string)\n  - `review_text` (long text)\n  - `rating` (integer)\nThe sentiment analysis should be performed using a pre-trained BERT model and the results should be stored in a new table called `sentiment_analysis`. The new table should have the following columns:\n- `review_id`\n- `customer_name`\n- `sentiment_score` (float, between -1 and 1)\n- `polarity` (string, either 'positive', 'negative' or 'neutral')\nAssume that you have the necessary credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL database. The Python script should be able to handle any errors that may occur during the sentiment analysis process.\nNote: You can use the following PostgreSQL connection string as an example:\n`postgresql://username:password@host:port/db_name`\nAlso, ensure that the Hugging Face Transformers library is installed in your environment by running `pip install transformers` before executing the script. The script should be able to handle a large number of reviews and perform the sentiment analysis efficiently.\n### Constraints\n- The Python script should use the `transformers` library version 4"
