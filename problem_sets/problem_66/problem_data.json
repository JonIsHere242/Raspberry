  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can predict patient outcomes for heart failure patients using ECG data collected from wearable devices. The system should incorporate a deep learning model and integrate with electronic health records (EHRs) to provide personalized treatment recommendations.\nGiven the dataset 'Heart Failure ECG Data' stored in the '/ecg_data/' folder, which contains CSV files named after the patient's ID (e.g., 'patient_001.csv'), each file containing the following columns: \n- Date of recording\n- Time of day\n- Heart rate\n- P-wave duration\n- QRS complex width\n- T-wave amplitude\n- ECG signal data\nThe system should:\n1. Preprocess the raw ECG signals using a combination of time and frequency domain analysis, including filtering, normalization, and feature extraction.\n2. Train a deep learning model (e.g., CNN or LSTM) on the preprocessed data to predict patient outcomes based on the following metrics:\n\t* All-cause mortality\n\t* Hospitalization due to heart failure\n\t* Quality of life\n3. Integrate with EHRs stored in the '/ehr_data/' folder, which contains CSV files named after the patient's ID (e.g., 'patient_001_ehr.csv'), each file containing additional clinical information such as:\n\t* Medical history\n\t* Medications\n\t* Lab results\n4. Develop a user interface to visualize patient outcomes and treatment recommendations, using libraries such as Matplotlib and"
