  "problem_statement": "Generate a complex open-ended problem in the science sector.\n**Problem:**\nDevelop an AI-powered framework that integrates machine learning with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to predict and mitigate the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems. \nGiven a set of high-resolution oceanographic data stored in a folder named \"Ocean_Data\" containing files with names in the format \"{location}.csv\", where each file contains columns for Date, Temperature, Salinity, pH, and Dissolved Oxygen levels.\nUsing Python 3.x as the primary scripting language, implement a deep learning model that takes into account the spatial and temporal variability of these factors to predict the impact on marine life. The model should be able to forecast the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs, fisheries, and other critical ecosystems within a specified area (e.g., the Great Barrier Reef).\nThe framework should comprise the following components:\n1.  Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data using techniques such as normalization, imputation, and feature scaling.\n2.  CFD Simulations: Utilize an existing CFD library like OpenFOAM or PyFR to simulate the ocean currents, temperature, and chemistry.\n3.  Machine Learning Model: Train a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, LSTM) that integrates the preprocessed data with the CFD simulations to predict the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems.\n4.  Visualization Tools: Develop interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn"
