  "problem_statement": "Develop an algorithm that predicts stock prices using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The model should account for the effects of both historical price data and news sentiment on future stock performance. Utilize the 'yfinance' library to download daily stock price data from Yahoo Finance, extract relevant features using 'pandas' and 'numpy', and train an LSTM network with SGD optimization using 'keras'.\nGiven a folder containing CSV files named after various stocks (e.g., 'AAPL.csv', 'GOOG.csv'), write a Python script that:\n1. Downloads the historical price data for all stocks in the specified time frame.\n2. Extracts relevant features from the price data, such as moving averages and RSI.\n3. Retrieves news sentiment data for each stock using an API (e.g., NewsAPI) or scraping techniques.\n4. Concatenates the feature matrices for all stocks into a single array.\n5. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.\n6. Trains an LSTM network with SGD optimization on the training set.\n7. Evaluates the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE).\n8. Saves the trained model to a file called 'stock_price_predictor.h5'.\nAssume that the folder containing the CSV files is located at '/Users/username/Documents/data/', and the API"
