  "problem_statement": "Create a math sector focused problem that meets the specified requirements:\n    \"In the research paper 'Quantum Information Processing with Non-Abelian Anyons' there is an equation describing the non-abelian statistics of Ising anyon excitations in a 2D topological superconductor. Given two arbitrary operators A and B in the Hilbert space of the system, can you derive the modified version of the equation using the tensor product representation of the Ising anyons and demonstrate its application to an experimental setup where the superconducting wires are placed at specific points on a hexagonal lattice? The problem requires you to use the mathematical software package Mathematica and the following libraries: LinearAlgebra, GroupTheory, Combinatorica.\n    You need to:\n    \n    1. Define the operators A and B in terms of creation and annihilation operators for the anyons.\n    2. Derive the tensor product representation of the Ising anyon excitations using the fusion rules.\n    3. Modify the equation from the research paper to include the effects of the experimental setup on the non-abelian statistics.\n    4. Implement the modified version of the equation in Mathematica and apply it to an arbitrary set of points on the hexagonal lattice.\n    The solution should result in a Mathematica notebook that contains the derivation, implementation, and application of the modified equation. Save the notebook as 'IsingAnyons.nb' in the '/Users/"
