  "problem_statement": "Develop a machine learning model that can predict stock prices using historical data in the 'Stock_History' folder. The folder contains csv files for each stock with columns for Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and AdjClose.\nThe goal is to create a model that can accurately forecast closing prices 30 days into the future for each stock. Use the ARIMA library in Python to develop the model. Your solution should include:\n- A description of your methodology\n- The code required to load the data from 'Stock_History' and preprocess it\n- The development and implementation of the ARIMA model\n- An evaluation of the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n- A demonstration of how to use the developed model to make predictions for a given stock\n- Your solution should also include any relevant visualizations and plots to help understand the results\nAssume that you have access to historical data from 2015 to the present day. You can use any other libraries or frameworks as necessary.\nCreate a new csv file called 'predicted_prices.csv' in the same directory, which includes the predicted closing prices for each stock over the next 30 days.\nYou should also write an accompanying report that explains your methodology and results in detail. The report should be at least 5 pages long (excluding any references or appendices) and include any relevant figures and tables. Use proper formatting and include"
