  "problem_statement": "**Problem Statement:**\nDevelop a mathematical model that simulates the dynamics of a complex network of interconnected power grids in a hypothetical region with diverse geographical and climatic conditions. The model should account for factors such as:\n- Time-varying demand due to diurnal patterns, seasonal changes, and random fluctuations\n- Weather-related disruptions (e.g., hurricanes, heatwaves)\n- Geographical constraints on transmission lines and substations\n- Aging infrastructure maintenance schedules\n- Renewable energy sources integration\nUsing Python with libraries such as NetworkX for graph representation, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, implement the following tasks:\n1.  Generate a synthetic dataset of power grid networks with approximately 50 nodes (substations) and 100 edges (transmission lines), reflecting realistic topological features.\n2.  Develop an algorithm to calculate time-varying demand at each node based on historical data or random processes that mimic real-world patterns.\n3.  Simulate the impact of weather-related disruptions on power grid stability, considering factors like reduced transmission capacity and increased demand.\n4.  Analyze the effects of aging infrastructure maintenance schedules on network resilience using metrics such as betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient.\n5.  Integrate renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind) into the power grid model, accounting for their intermittent nature and varying capacities.\nThe solution should provide:\n- A comprehensive report detailing the mathematical model's development and its implementation in Python"
