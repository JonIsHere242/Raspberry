Given a dataset containing historical customer information and their behavior, develop a predictive model to identify potential churners.\n**Dataset:**\n- `customer_data.csv` in the `/data/incoming/` directory contains columns: Customer ID (unique identifier), Plan Type (e.g., Basic, Premium), Monthly Charges, Total Churned (1 for yes, 0 for no).\n- `usage_data.csv` in the same directory contains columns: Customer ID (matching with customer_data.csv), Usage Hours, Data MB Used.\n**Task:**\nUsing Python and scikit-learn library, perform the following tasks:\n1. Preprocess both datasets by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.\n2. Merge the two datasets based on the `Customer ID`.\n3. Extract relevant features from the merged dataset that can predict churn (e.g., usage patterns, plan type).\n4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).\n5. Train a machine learning model to predict customer churn using a suitable algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).\n6. Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.\n7. Provide insights into which features are most relevant"
