  "problem_statement": "**Problem Statement:**\nDevelop a system using Python and its associated libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn) that can analyze the sentiment of stock tweets using NLP techniques.\nGiven a folder named 'Twitter_Stock_Data' containing CSV files where each file represents the tweets for a specific stock ticker symbol, with columns for Date, Tweet_Text, Sentiment_Label, and Ticker:\n1. Use Natural Language Processing to classify the sentiment of the tweet as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.\n2. Apply Text Preprocessing techniques such as Tokenization, Stopword removal, Lemmatization, and Stemming to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.\n3. Utilize a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) trained on a labeled dataset to classify the sentiment of new tweets.\n4. Create a feature set that includes metrics such as Tweet Length, Word Count, and Frequency of Sentiment-Indicative Words.\n5. Implement a data visualization module using matplotlib to display a bar chart showing the top 10 most active stocks based on the number of positive, negative, or neutral tweets.\n6. Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to select a stock ticker symbol and view a scatter plot displaying the sentiment scores over time for that specific stock.\n**Requirements:**\n* The system should be able to analyze the sentiment of at least 1000 unique stocks within the 'Twitter_Stock_Data' folder.\n*"
