  "problem_statement": "**Problem:**\nDevelop a predictive model for sea level rise in coastal areas using machine learning techniques. The goal is to forecast future sea levels with high accuracy, taking into account various environmental and climate factors.\n**Dataset:**\n*   Obtain the historical sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dataset stored in the `/data/sea_level_rise` folder.\n*   The dataset consists of daily records of sea level heights for various coastal stations across the globe, including tidal ranges, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, ocean currents, and other environmental factors.\n**Task:**\n1.  **Data Preprocessing:**\n    *   Load the NOAA dataset from `/data/sea_level_rise` using Python's Pandas library.\n    *   Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables as necessary (e.g., log scaling for tidal ranges).\n    *   Split the preprocessed data into training (~70%) and testing sets (~30%).\n2.  **Feature Engineering:**\n    *   Extract relevant features from the dataset that might affect sea level rise, such as:\n        +   Seasonal and monthly patterns in tidal ranges\n        +   Correlations between atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and ocean currents\n        +   Trends in sea level heights over time\n    *   Use techniques like Fourier transform, wavelet analysis, or statistical modeling to extract these features.\n3.  **Model Development:**"
