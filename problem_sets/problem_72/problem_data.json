Extracts relevant genetic information from the JSON formatted genomic data.\n2. Maps this information onto clinically meaningful features (e.g., gene expression levels).\n3. Trains a predictive model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to forecast treatment efficacy for new patients based on their genomic profile and clinical history.\n### Deliverables:\n- A Python script that integrates the required libraries and frameworks (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, json).\n- A 'predictive_model' directory containing the trained model and any necessary configuration files.\n- A 'unified_framework' directory with the pipeline for data preprocessing and feature extraction.\n### Note:\nThis is a high-level problem statement. You are expected to break it down into actionable steps, manage dependencies, and implement efficient solutions using Python libraries. Ensure your solution is well-documented and follows best practices for"
