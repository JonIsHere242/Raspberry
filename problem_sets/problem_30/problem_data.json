  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI system that can predict patient readmission risk within 30 days of hospital discharge based on electronic health records (EHRs) and other external factors. The system should integrate with the existing healthcare information system, extract relevant data from various sources, and apply machine learning models to identify high-risk patients.\n**Data Sources:**\n* EHRs stored in a relational database management system accessible via ODBC connection\n* External health-related datasets (e.g., Medicare claims, social determinants of health)\n* Demographic data from the patient's primary care physician\n**System Requirements:**\n1. **Data Preprocessing:** Develop a Python script that extracts relevant EHR data from the database using SQL queries and external dataset APIs.\n2. **Feature Engineering:** Implement techniques to transform raw data into meaningful features, such as:\n\t* Extracting medical concepts (e.g., diagnoses, procedures) using natural language processing\n\t* Normalizing numerical values for consistency across datasets\n3. **Model Selection and Training:**\n\t* Compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks)\n\t* Train models on a subset of the data to evaluate their accuracy and robustness\n4. **Integration with Healthcare Information System:** Design an API to interact with the EHR system, allowing for real-time updates and notifications when a patient is identified as high-risk.\n5. **Visualization and Reporting:** Develop interactive dashboards to display key"
