  "problem_statement": "Develop an AI that can simulate a realistic dynamic environment, such as a 3D urban landscape with moving vehicles, pedestrians, buildings, and other objects. The simulation should include real-time physics-based interactions between these entities.\n**Problem Statement:**\nGiven a dataset of traffic patterns in a large city (available in the \"Traffic_Data\" folder), create an AI system using Python that can simulate a realistic dynamic environment, including:\n- A 3D urban landscape with moving vehicles and pedestrians\n- Realistic physics-based interactions between vehicles, pedestrians, buildings, and other objects\n- Dynamic lighting and weather effects\n- Real-time collision detection and response\n**Requirements:**\n* Use the Unity game engine (version 2020.3 or later) for the simulation environment\n* Utilize the C# programming language for scripting and AI development\n* Integrate with relevant libraries and frameworks, such as:\n\t+ PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning and neural network implementations\n\t+ OpenCV for computer vision tasks\n\t+ NumPy and SciPy for scientific computing and numerical methods\n* The simulation should run at a minimum frame rate of 60 FPS on a mid-range GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti)\n* The AI system should be capable of:\n\t+ Predicting traffic patterns based on historical data\n\t+ Optimizing traffic flow by adjusting traffic light timings and pedestrian crossings\n\t+ Simulating emergency scenarios, such as accidents or natural disasters"
