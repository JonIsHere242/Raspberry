  "problem_statement": "Develop a predictive model using Python with the scikit-learn library that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data from Yahoo Finance. Given a folder named 'Stock_Price_Historicals' containing CSV files of stock tickers and their corresponding closing price over time, design a model that can predict the next 30 days' stock prices for each ticker.\nAssume the historical data spans at least two years with a daily frequency. Your solution should involve feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation. You should also handle missing values appropriately and provide metrics to evaluate your model's performance.\nThe CSV files in 'Stock_Price_Historicals' have the following structure:\n- Date (date of the closing price)\n- Close (the closing price)\nYour solution should output a new CSV file named 'Predictions.csv' containing the predicted stock prices for each ticker over the next 30 days. The CSV file should have the following columns:\n- Ticker\n- Predicted Price\nYou can assume that the data is stored in the local machine and you have access to the Yahoo Finance API if needed.\nNote: You should use techniques like ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet for your predictive model and ensure it's a production-ready solution. Also, handle any edge cases appropriately. \n### Solution:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Linear"
