  "problem_statement": "\"Develop a predictive model in R that utilizes a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in major metropolitan areas. Utilize the Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dataset stored in the 'COVID_Stats' folder, which includes files with names like 'New_York_City.csv', each containing columns for Date, New_Cases, Total_Cases, and Total_Deaths.\nDesign an architecture that leverages LSTM to capture temporal dependencies in case numbers and GCNs to incorporate spatial relationships between metropolitan areas. Employ the following parameters:\n- LSTM: 2 hidden layers with 256 neurons each, dropout rate of 0.2\n- GCN: 3 hidden layers with 128 neurons each, ReLU activation function\nTrain the model on a subset of the data (e.g., 'New_York_City.csv', 'Los_Angeles.csv') and validate it on another subset (e.g., 'Chicago.csv'). Include a section for visualizing the predicted spread using heatmaps to identify areas with high risk.\nOutput the forecasted case numbers for each metropolitan area over the next 30 days, storing them in a new csv file named 'COVID_Forecasts.csv' within the 'Forecasting_Results' folder. Ensure the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared percentage"
