Given a CSV file named 'user_activity.csv' located at '/data/ecommerce/user_activity/' folder, with columns for User ID, Date, Time, Product Purchased, Quantity, Total Spend, and Category, write a program to:\n- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data from 7 features down to 3.\n- Use Isolation Forest algorithm from scikit-learn to identify anomalies in the usage patterns of users based on their purchases.\n- Create a new dataframe that includes only the identified anomalous transactions and save it as 'anomalous_transactions.csv' in the '/data/ecommerce/anomalies/' folder.\n- Visualize the top 10 most anomalous products using Seaborn's bar chart, with product names on the x-axis and anomaly scores on the y-axis, saving the plot as 'top_anomalous_products.png'.\nThe program should handle missing values by imputing them using KNNImputer from scikit-learn. The Isolation Forest algorithm should be tuned to achieve an optimal number of clusters that capture anomalies effectively.\nAssume that there are around 1000 unique users, and each user has made at least one purchase. The 'user_activity.csv' file contains approximately 50000 rows"
