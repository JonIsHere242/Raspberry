The file has columns for age, weight, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and medical history (a binary indicator of any previous conditions). \nThe script should calculate and display the Z-score for each patient record and categorize them into three groups: normal patients (Z-scores between -2 and 2), potential outliers (Z-scores outside this range but within -3 to 3), and confirmed outliers (Z-scores below -3 or above 3). \nSave the categorized records to a new CSV file named 'categorized_patients.csv'. The script should also calculate and display the correlation coefficient between blood pressure and heart rate, as well as between temperature and medical history.\nFile Path: '/home/user/healthcare_data/patient_data.csv' \nAssume that all data is numerical and can be treated as normally distributed. Use appropriate scaling for each feature if necessary.  Also ensure your code is readable and maintainable with clear variable names and proper comments. \nNote: Ensure to handle any errors or missing values in the input CSV file properly, and consider using robust statistical methods when calculating Z-scores. \nLanguage: Python \nLibraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn (for Z-score calculation), NumPy (for numerical computations) \nFramework: None required but use of"
