  "problem_statement": "\"Develop an algorithm in Python leveraging the 'scikit-learn' library to implement a fuzzy clustering approach using the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm on high-dimensional data from a database of IoT sensors.\nThe database is stored in a PostgreSQL database with the following schema:\n    CREATE TABLE Sensor_Data (\n        sensor_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n        measurement_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n        temperature REAL NOT NULL,\n        humidity REAL NOT NULL,\n        pressure REAL NOT NULL\n    );\nYou will need to connect to this database, retrieve all measurements for each sensor over a period of 30 days, and then apply the FCM algorithm with 5 clusters.\nAfter clustering, you should save the results in a new table called 'clustered_sensors' in the same PostgreSQL database. This table should contain the original sensor data along with the cluster assignment for each measurement.\nAdditionally, you should visualize the clustering result using a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to better understand the structure of the high-dimensional data.\nUse the 'matplotlib' library for visualization and ensure that your code is well-documented with comments explaining the different steps.\nAssume that you have access to the PostgreSQL database credentials, and provide the necessary Python code to accomplish this task.\" ### Note: The problem statement assumes prior knowledge of working with databases, clustering algorithms, and data visualization libraries in Python. It requires a comprehensive solution involving data retrieval, processing, clustering, and visualization"
