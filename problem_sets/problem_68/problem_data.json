You are given a dataset containing historical power consumption data from various regions in a country.\n**Dataset:** `Power_Grid_Data.csv` located at `/Users/username/Documents/Data/`\nThe CSV file contains the following columns:\n- `Date`: Date of consumption\n- `Region`: Region of consumption (e.g., North, South, East)\n- `Consumption`: Total power consumption in megawatts\nUsing Python with libraries pandas and statsmodels for time series analysis, write a script to:\n1. **Trend Analysis**: Apply a suitable trend analysis technique (e.g., linear or exponential) to identify the overall pattern of power consumption over time.\n2. **Seasonality Analysis**: Identify periodic patterns in the data using seasonal decomposition techniques (e.g., STL or SES).\n3. **ARIMA Modeling**: Develop an ARIMA model that captures both trends and seasonality, predicting future power grid demand for a specified horizon (e.g., 30 days ahead).\n**Output:**\n- A new CSV file named `Predictions.csv` located at `/Users/username/Documents/Data/` containing the predicted power consumption for each region over the specified horizon.\n- A line graph showing the actual and predicted values of power consumption for one specific region.\n**Note:** Ensure your script is well-documented, readable,"
